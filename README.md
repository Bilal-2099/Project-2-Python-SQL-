# Project 2: Python & SQL  
A hands-on data analysis project combining Python scripting and SQL queries to derive insights from structured data.

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview  
In this project, I used Python and SQL to work with orders data, clean it, query it, and produce meaningful outputs. The work showcases my ability to blend programming (Python) and data-warehouse tools (SQL) for real-world use.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook) for data loading, cleaning, and transformation  
- **SQL** (in `.sql` file) for querying, aggregation, and reporting  
- **CSV file** (`orders.csv`) as the source dataset  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Key Features  
- Load `orders.csv`, perform data checks and preprocessing in Python  
- Write SQL queries to group, filter, and summarise orders data (see `SQLQuery1.sql`)  
- Combine Python results and SQL analytics to produce simple reports
